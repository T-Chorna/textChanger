# Project "City Information Replacer"

## Project Description

This project is a training exercise that involves creating a function which takes a text in CSV format and returns another function. 
The returned function can then be used to replace city names in any given text with a formatted string like 
`"City Name" (Xth place in the TOP-10 largest cities of Ukraine, population YYYYYY person/people)`.


## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

/project-root

│

├── index.html

└── main.js


### Files

- **main.js**: This file contains the core JavaScript function which performs the city name replacement as described in the task.
- **index.html**: A basic HTML file to easily test the functionality of the `main.js` file in a browser environment.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your computer:
>git clone https://github.com/T-Chorna/textChanger

2. Open the **index.html** file in your browser.

You can do this by double-clicking the file or by selecting "Open File" from your browser's menu.

3. To test the function, you can modify the text within the **index.html** or directly use the developer console to call functions from **main.js**.

## Requirements
